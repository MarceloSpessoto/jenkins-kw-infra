# The `keys` directory

This is where all ssh keys generated by `deploy.sh` will be placed.  
You should also manually place your GitHub Apps converted key (following [these instructions](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci/latest/cloud-admin-guide/github-app-auth)) 
here, named as `github-app.pem`
